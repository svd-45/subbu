Okay, let's focus on configuring your Grafana rule within the specific context of the `forgerock-metrics` chart and the Forgerock directory structure that it is monitoring. Given the provided `values.yaml` snippet:

```yaml
am:
  component: am
  enabled: true
  path: /am/json/metrics/prometheus
  port: am
  labelSelectorComponent: am
  secretUser: prometheus
  secretPassword: prometheus

ds:
  component: directory
  enabled: true
  path: /metrics/prometheus
  port: http
  labelSelectorComponent: directory
  labelSelectorName: ds
  secretUser: monitor
  secretPassword: password

idm:
  component: idm
  enabled: true
  path: /openidm/metrics/prometheus
  port: idm
  labelSelectorComponent: idm
  secretUser: prometheus
  secretPassword: prometheus

ig:
  component: ig
  enabled: true
  path: /openig/metrics/prometheus
  port: ig
  labelSelectorComponent: ig
  secretUser: metric
  secretPassword: password

additionalRulesLabels:
  prometheus: prometheus-operator
  role: alert-rules
```

**Goal:**

The goal is to create an alert rule targeted specifically at a particular Forgerock component (e.g., AM, DS, IDM, or IG) and ensure it is deployed and active within Grafana.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Target a Specific Component:** Determine which Forgerock component the alert rule should apply to. We'll assume it's the "AM" (Access Management) component for this example.

2.  **Craft the Grafana Dashboard JSON:**

    *   Create or modify your Grafana dashboard JSON to target the metrics exposed by the chosen Forgerock component (AM in our case).
    *   **Crucially, ensure the `expr` (expression) in your alert rule uses the correct Prometheus metrics and labels** for the AM component.  You'll need to understand the metrics exposed at `/am/json/metrics/prometheus`.
    *   **Use the component's labels for filtering:**  The labels defined in your `values.yaml` snippet (`labelSelectorComponent: am`) can be leveraged in your alert rule's Prometheus query.

    Here's an example:

    }
    ```

    *   **`targets[0].expr`:** This is the *most important* part.  This Prometheus query:
        *   `process_cpu_seconds_total` This would need to be adjusted with AM exposed metrics.
        *   `job='prometheus'`:  Adjust to match the job name used by Prometheus to scrape your AM metrics.
        *   `component='am'`: This *directly uses* the `labelSelectorComponent: am` value from your `values.yaml`.  It filters the metric to only include data for the AM component.  **This is key to targeting the alert to the AM service.**
    *   **`datasource:"${DS_PROMETHEUS}"`**:  Datasource for prometheus, adjust according to your configuration.

3.  **Create a ConfigMap (per AM component):**

    Now, create a ConfigMap specifically for the AM component's alert dashboard:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard
      labels:
        grafana-dashboard: "1"   # Ensure this matches chart's configuration
        component: am             # AM-specific label (for future targeting if needed)
    data:
      am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json: |
        {
          "dashboard": {
            // Your AM CPU Usage Alert dashboard JSON from step 2 goes here
          }
        }
    ```

    *   **`metadata.labels.component: am`**: Add this label in addition to label grafana-dashboard, You might not need it *now*, but it gives you the *option* to further target ConfigMaps based on the component.

4.  **Modify `values.yaml` (Targeted ConfigMap Loading - OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED):**

    Ideally, you want a mechanism to selectively enable or disable alerts for each component.  This requires a modification to the Helm chart's templates, but here's how you'd *prepare* the `values.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    am:
      component: am
      enabled: true
      path: /am/json/metrics/prometheus
      port: am
      labelSelectorComponent: am
      secretUser: prometheus
      secretPassword: prometheus
      grafana_dashboard:
        enabled: true  # Enable AM-specific dashboard
    ds:
      component: directory
      enabled: true
      path: /metrics/prometheus
      port: http
      labelSelectorComponent: directory
      labelSelectorName: ds
      secretUser: monitor
      secretPassword: password
      grafana_dashboard:
        enabled: false # Disable DS dashboard by default
    ```

    Then, the chart's ConfigMap template needs to *conditionally* include the dashboard based on the `am.grafana_dashboard.enabled` value.  This is more advanced Helm templating.

5.  **Modify the Helm Chart's ConfigMap Template (Requires Chart Modification):**

    In the Helm chart's `templates` directory, find the template that generates the Grafana ConfigMaps.  Modify it to conditionally include your new ConfigMap based on `values.yaml` settings:

    ```yaml
    {{- if .Values.am.grafana_dashboard.enabled }}
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard
      namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
      labels:
        grafana-dashboard: "1"
        component: am
    data:
      am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json: |
        {{ .Files.Get "files/am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json" | nindent 8 }}
    {{- end }}
    ```

    *   **Assumptions:**
        *   You've placed your `am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json` file in a directory named `files/` within your chart.
        *   The chart uses `.Release.Namespace` for the namespace.
    *   **`{{- if .Values.am.grafana_dashboard.enabled }}`**: This is the key part. It conditionally includes the ConfigMap only if `am.grafana_dashboard.enabled` is set to `true` in your `values.yaml`.

6.  **Store your AM rule file:**

    You need to store your `am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json` in files/am-cpu-usage-alert-dashboard.json directory

7.  **Upgrade Helm Deployment:**

    ```bash
    helm upgrade -i forgerock-metrics forgerock-metrics/ -f values.yaml -n <your_namespace>
    ```

**Summary & Key Points**

*   **Target the Component:**  The most important aspect is to *target the correct component's metrics* in your alert rule's Prometheus query. Use the labels defined in your `values.yaml` (e.g., `labelSelectorComponent: am`).
*   **Conditional Inclusion (Recommended):**  Modify the Helm chart's templates to conditionally include dashboards based on settings in `values.yaml`. This provides flexibility to enable or disable alerts for different components.
*   **Clear Naming:**  Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your ConfigMaps, dashboards, and files.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test in a non-production environment.
*   **Helm Chart Modifications:** This approach *requires modifications to the `forgerock-metrics` Helm chart's templates*. This means you'll need to be comfortable with Helm templating. If you cannot modify the chart, you can still create the ConfigMap separately, but you'll lose the ability to manage it through the `values.yaml` file.
*   **Datasource:** Check your datasource connectivity settings and ensure that component data can be obtained.

By following these steps, you can create a Grafana alert rule specifically targeted to the AM component within your `forgerock-metrics` deployment, and manage its deployment through the Helm chart. Adapt the instructions for other components as needed.
